React interview questions:-
>> React works on the virtual DOM (or fake DOM like i call it) and not on the actual DOM 
		- virtual DOM eases the work on the browser thereby reducing paint/render time.
>> unidirectional flow of data ?? parent-to-child. easy to debug and predictable application state.
>> reusable components 
>> Reconciliation in React:-
	- it means how does react handle updates and rendering? 
		A. react difference algo runs on virtual DOM and actual DOM .
		This process of diffing is called "Data Reconciliation"
		
>> How does data flow? and what are props and state ?
		Props: read only properties from parent to child 
		State: it is internal to a comp & holds info on that component.
				Note:- States can also be "passed as a prop" to the child, but for the child, it will be a read only prop. 
				
					this.state.name 
					this.props.name 
					
>> What are refs in react? 
	- react creates its own DOM and u cannot access it.any changes to its data is done using props or state.
		But sometimes, u may want to do things like bring focus to an element, etc. 
	- refs are like getElementById() . use it only it becomes really necessary.
	
>> React Fiber
	- user action becomes non-blocking when diffing algo becomes heavy.

>> Synthetic events in react:-
	- events triggered are handled by react and react forwards it to the browser.
	- react is man in the middle as diff. browsers handle events different and react prevents browser-specific code to be written.
	
>> Hooks
	- make state logic reusable, testable.
	- now everything is function based component and nothing is class based component.

Controlled vs uncontrolled components:-
	Controlled comps:-	React has complete control of the comp and it can handle form data. 
	Uncontrolled comps:- form data is handled by DOM and not react component . Here we use refs in react.

setState:- ??
