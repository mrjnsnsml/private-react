1) react + redux + ES5 : https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ae1okq?file=src%2Freducers%2Findex.js
   increment/decrement initial stages.
   Can we achieve these (like in angular)?
      a) actions & dispatching actions
      b) reducers: returning a mutated version of state tree
      c) selectors: getting a slice of the state tree.
      d) perfecting actions using | (pipes)
      e) sagas (basic saga, not in depth)
2) Do same in a react + typescript project.
3) Same project, expand to handle buttonclick, dropdown change, keydown-event and update UI (html.
4) Same project with Sagas in depth.
5) Same project with Thunk in depth, if possible.
6) Same project, unit testing
7) Same project, with Material UI
8) Same Project, with Konva JS (nice to have).
9) Same Project, with user registration.
10) Same Project, with kendo grid, kendo drawer.
11) Same Project, with IIFE design pattern . Explore other ES5 design patterns and document its examples.
12) React forms eg.
